## 🏗️ Architecture & Components

### ⚙️ Storage Abstraction Layer

Smart detection for environment:

```ts
const isChromeExtension = (): boolean => {
  return typeof chrome !== 'undefined' && chrome.storage !== undefined;
};
```

### 🧱 Responsive Components

Dynamically adjusted styles based on context:

```tsx
<h3 className={cn(
  'font-medium truncate text-left', 
  isExtension ? 'text-xs' : (isMobile ? 'text-sm' : 'text-base mb-1')
)}>
  {displayTitle}
</h3>
```

### 🧰 Build Pipeline for Chrome

Custom Vite plugin for extension packaging:

```ts
{
  name: 'copy-extension-files',
  apply: 'build',
  closeBundle: async () => {
    // Extension-specific file generation and copying
  }
}
```
